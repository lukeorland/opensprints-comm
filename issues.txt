if we send version 1 a v message, we get no newline. Therefore on any system that does not respond to a newline, we should set the distance once and throw away the result before because the response to the first one may be "basic-1OK 0\r\n"


if we send version 1 a distance > 32767 ticks, the arduino will record it as -1
therefore to handle this the desktop app needs to raise an error if the user has basic-1 and a tries a distance greater than 32767

basic-2 onward, only raise error if the user sets a distance greater than 255 * 256 + 255
